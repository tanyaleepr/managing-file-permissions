# managing-file-permissions

As a security professional at a large organization, Bubble Inc. I work as part of the research team which includes to ensure users on the team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

The task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. It is needed to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, I will need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.
